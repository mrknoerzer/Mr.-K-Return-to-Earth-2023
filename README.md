## 03.7 Do Now

Press the button on the webpage to change it up! Then answer the questions below:

1. What changed about the webpage when you clicked the button?
2. Take a look at line 6 of the JavaScript. Based on what changed, what do you think `innerHTML` does?
3. Take a look at line 7 of the JavaScript. Based on what changed, what do you think `.style` does? 

## If you have time...
Try to change the following things:
- On line 6 of the JavaScript, make it so that the header says your name when the button is clicked.
- On line 7 of the JavaScript, make it so that the image is 500px when the button is clicked.
